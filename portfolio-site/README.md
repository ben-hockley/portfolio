# Portfolio Site

This is a simple portfolio site created by Ben Hockley. It showcases projects and provides a way for visitors to contact the developer.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML document for the portfolio site, containing sections for about, projects, and contact.
- `dist/output.css`: The compiled CSS styles for the portfolio site.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

To host this site on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Push your `portfolio-site` project to the repository.
3. Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
4. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
5. Select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`) and the root folder.
6. Save the settings, and your site will be published at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

Make sure your `index.html` file is in the root of the repository for GitHub Pages to serve it correctly.
